# Oldest Group

At a birthday party, your friends are playing a game to determine which group of people are the oldest.

Since you're a programmer, you decide to write a C program.

Write a program `oldest_group.c` which scans the following input:

1. The first line of input contains the integer $N$, the number of groups.
2. The following $N$ pairs of lines describe a group each. The first line in each pair holds the value $K_i$, which is the number of people in the group. The second line is $K_i$ elements long and describes the ages of the people in that group.

Your program should then output the group with the largest sum of their ages. 

If two groups have the same sum of ages, print the group with the lower group number.

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/oldest_group
$ dcc oldest_group.c -o oldest_group
$ ./oldest_group
2
5
26 19 31 23 28
4
56 34 47 29
2
```

```bash:~/1511-revision/oldest_group
$ ./oldest_group
3
2
35 27
2 
48 23
1
98
3
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

For all test cases:
- $1 ≤ N ≤ 1000$
- $1 ≤ K_i ≤ 1000$
- The age of any person $A$ is an integer $1 ≤ A ≤ 100$

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/oldest_group:~
$ 1511 autotest oldest_group
```
