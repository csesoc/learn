# Charming Three

Bob thinks three is a lucky number - the Three Musketeers, the Holy Trinity, the three witches in Macbeth - it pops up everywhere. So he always collects numbers in groups of three.

However, what's better than three numbers? Three sorted numbers! Let's help Bob out.

Write a function, sort_three, that takes in three integer pointers as arguments and sorts the values they point to in increasing order.

If you would like a challenge, try to accomplish this by using a single comparison operator, > no more than three times!

Given `5 2 7\n` as input, it should print `2 5 7` to sort them.

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/charming_three
$ dcc charming_three.c -o charming_three
$ ./charming_three
5 2 7
2 5 7
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

All numbers that the pointer points to are positive.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/charming_three:~
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest charming_three
```
