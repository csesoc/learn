# Best Youtuber

Your program is given a list of thought-provoking YouTube videos. Each video has a creator and a number of likes. (They don’t, however, have any dislikes because YouTube removed the dislike button. 😢)

Your task is to print out the YouTuber from among the videos with the best likes-to-videos ratio, along with that YouTuber's video count and total number of likes to prove it. They are thusly crowned the best YouTuber!

A YouTuber’s likes-to-videos ratio is calculated by `their total likes / their number of videos`.

If there's a tie, the program should print "It's a tie! There is no best YouTuber."

Each line of input will be in the format `[video creator], [video likes]` (note the separating comma).

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/best_youtuber
$ dcc best_youtuber.c -o best_youtuber
$ ./best_youtuber
**Wild Candy, 84317**
**Logan Paul, 9185**
**Wild Candy, 20097**
**Jaden Smith, 35664**
**Wild Candy, 15321**
**Logan Paul, 75820**
<CTRL+D>
Logan Paul is the best YouTuber.
Number of videos: 2
Total likes: 85005
```

Explanation: There are three YouTubers found from among the given videos: Wild Candy, Logan Paul, and Jaden Smith. Calculating each of their likes-to-videos ratios gives `39,911.66...`, `2,502.5`, and `35,664`, respectively. As Logan Paul has the greatest likes-to-videos ratio, he's the best YouTuber.

```bash:~/1511-revision/best_youtuber
$ dcc best_youtuber.c -o best_youtuber
$ ./best_youtuber
**Will Smith, 2000**
**Logan Paul, 2000**
**Will Smith, 2000**
<CTRL+D>
It's a tie! There is no best YouTuber.
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

You can assume each YouTuber's name contains no more than 128 characters (including the '\0' null terminator).

As you're calculating a ratio, fractional numbers will be involved. Please use a `double` for this (and not `float`, for example). Note that the nature of floating-point numbers like `double` and `float` mean they can experience a loss of precision when doing certain operations. You do not have to account for this loss of precision; just use `double` as though it'll always be accurate!

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/best_youtuber
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest best_youtuber
```
