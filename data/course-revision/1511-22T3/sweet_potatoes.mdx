# X marks the Starch

You've recently been reading the news and have seen a gap in the market for delicious, delectable sweet potatoes!
You've decided to set up shop at Town Hall, but unfortunately, you can only serve people in a cross pattern!

```
X 0 X
0 X 0
X 0 X
```

Even worse, your constant back pain forces you to stay still for the entire day.
Luckily, you've prepared for this and you have a map with **m** rows and **n** columns that contains the density of people who walk throughout Town Hall everyday.
You know that everyone will want to taste your sweet potatoes as long as you can serve them. Therefore, your task is to write a program `sweet_potatoes.c` that finds the best place to put your cart so that you will end up serving the most people!

For each testcase, print three integers - the row and column index (starting from **0**) of the best position to place your cart, and the total number of people you will serve.

The first line contains integer **m, n**.
The next **m** lines will have **n** integers **r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, ...,r<sub>n</sub>** denoting the density of people at that coordinate.

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash
Input:
$ dcc sweet_potatoes.c -o sweet_potatoes
$ ./sweet_potatoes
3 5
15 23 33 81 15
01 93 51 53 12
08 38 24 12 53
1 2 205
```

### Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

$3 \leq m,   n \leq 10^5$  
$0 \leq r<sub>i</sub> \leq 10^5$ for any $1 \leq i \leq n$.
Note that this means your inputs will fit inside an `int`.

If there exists multiple places where it is best to place your cart, any applicable answer is accepted.

Note that you can place your cart at indexes where it is not possible to form an X shape.
For example,

```
X 0 0
0 X 0
0 0 0
```

at the uppermost left corner of your map.

Hint: You can dynamically allocate an array by defining an array of int pointers in the form `int **arr`.
This can be thought as a pointer to a bunch of integer pointers, which can then be thought of as a sort of 2D array when dynamically allocated.

```
**int -> *int   *int   *int   *int
           |      |      |      |
          int    int    int    int
```

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/sweet_potatoes
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest sweet_potatoes
```
