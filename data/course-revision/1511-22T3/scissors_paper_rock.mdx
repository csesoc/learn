# Scissors Paper Rock

Write a program `scissors_paper_rock` that takes the moves of two players in a '_best of 3_' game of Scissors Paper Rock and returns the winner.

The program should scan two lines of input:

1. Each line will contain a string, representing the moves of each player
2. Valid moves include the characters R, S, and P

**Output Format**  
Print the following strings for the scenarios below.

**_If Player 1 wins_**

```c
Player 1 won!
```

**_If Player 2 wins_**

```c
Player 2 won!
```

**_If the game is a draw_**

```c
It's a draw!
```

**_If invalid moves are entered for either or both players_**

```c
Moves invalid!
```

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/scissors_paper_rock
$ dcc scissors_paper_rock.c -o scissors_paper_rock
$ ./scissors_paper_rock
S P R
R R S
Player 1 won!
```

```bash:~/1511-revision/scissors_paper_rock
$ dcc scissors_paper_rock.c -o scissors_paper_rock
$ ./scissors_paper_rock
S R P
R P S
Player 2 won!
```

```bash:~/1511-revision/scissors_paper_rock
$ dcc scissors_paper_rock.c -o scissors_paper_rock
$ ./scissors_paper_rock
A B C
D E F
Moves invalid!
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

- There are three rounds in this game.
- Rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper and paper wins against rock.
- Rock is represented by the character `R`, scissors by the character `S`, and paper by the character `P`.
- The validity of input strings is not guaranteed.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/scissors_paper_rock:~
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest scissors_paper_rock
```
