# Rotate Linked List

You are provided list_rotate.c. Implement the function `rotate` which, given the head of a linked list, the length of the list, and a non-negative integer input `steps`, rotates the list to the right by `steps`.

For example:

<img
  src="/images/comp1511-revision/diagram.png"
  alt="linked_list_rotation_example"
  width="800"
  height="474"
/>

The output should look exactly like the following:

```bash:~/1511-revision/list_rotate
$ dcc list_rotate.c -o list_rotate
$ ./list_rotate
How many numbers in list?: 5
0 1 2 3 4
What number to rotate by?: 0
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
$ ./list_rotate
How many numbers in list?: 5
0 1 2 3 4
What number to rotate by?: 2
[3, 4, 0, 1, 2]
$ ./list_rotate
How many numbers in list?: 5
0 1 2 3 4
What number to rotate by?: 6
[4, 0, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

- You may assume that `steps >= 0`.
- You may assume that the list is non-empty.
- You may assume the list length will be less than 100 (but you shouldn't be hard coding any limits, it should theoretically work for any size).
- You may **_not_** assume that `steps <= list length`.
- Do not change any existing functions other than `rotate`. You may make your own functions if wish.
- You do not need to worry about a horrific eldritch abomination destroying your computer midway through runtime.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/list_rotate
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest list_rotate
```

## Acknowledgements

The starter code for this exercise was largely taken from the Week 08 COMP1511 lab exercise â€” "Reverse a Linked List".
