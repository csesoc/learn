# strcmp

Your task is to implement the C Standard Library function `strcmp`. `strcmp` takes in two `const char *` and returns an integer depending on the differences between the two strings.

`strcmp` works by sequentially going through both strings and comparing each character.
If `char 1` < `char 2`, then we would return `-1`.
If `char 1 > char 2`, then we would return `1`.

However, If both strings equal each other, then we would return `0`.

For example,

```
strcmp("hi", "hi") -> 0
strcmp("a", "b") -> -1
```

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/strcmp
$ dcc strcmp.c -o strcmp
$ ./strcmp "hello" "hello"
0
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

You should not use the library implementation of `strcmp` as that defeats the whole purpose of this exercise.

It is guaranteed that your function is only expected to return `0`, `1`, and `-1`.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/strcmp
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest strcmp
```
