# strlen

Your task is to implement the C Standard Library function `strlen`. `strlen` takes in a `const char *` and returns an integer that is the length of the given string,

````
The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:
```bash:~/1511-revision/strlen
$ dcc strlen -o strlen
$ ./strlen "hi"
2
````

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

You should not use the library implementation of `strlen` as that defeats the whole purpose of this exercise.

Note that `strlen` does not count the null terminator `\0` as part of a string's length.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/strlen
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest strlen
```
