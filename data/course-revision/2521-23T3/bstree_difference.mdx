# Binary Search Tree Difference

Given a binary search tree, determine the minimum difference between any two
different values in it. You may assume that the BST has at least two nodes.

Implement the function `bstree_difference` in `bstree_difference.c`. This
function will then be called by the `main` function in `bstree_difference.c`.

To run your solution:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_difference
$ make
$ ./test_bstree_difference
```

## Input format

Upon running `./test_bstree_difference`, the user will be prompted to provide a
single line to standard input. This line should contain a space-separated list
of integer values, representing the preorder traversal of the BST.

## Output format

The program will write to stdout. It will print `Minimum difference: ` followed
by the return value of the call made to `bstree_difference`.

## Sample

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_difference
11 7 4 20 18 23 30
```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_difference
Minimum difference: 2
```

Explanation:

The BST is

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_difference
     11
    /  \
   /    \
  7     20
 /     /  \
4     /    \
     18    23
             \
             30
```

and the minimum difference between any two different values in it is 20 - 18 = 2.

## Assumptions

- The input list contains at least two and at most `MAX_BST_SIZE` values.
- Each input value is positive and can represented by an `int` in C.
- The number of characters in the input is at most `MAX_LINE_LEN - 1`.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_difference
$ 2521 autotest bstree_difference
```

## Extra challenges

Any efficient solution, such as one that runs in O(n) or O(n log n), should pass
all of the autotests, but here are some extra challenges if you're interested:

- Solve the problem using O(h) additional space, where h is the height of the BST.
  Hint: consider performing an inorder traversal of the BST.
- Solve the problem using O(1) additional space.
  Hint: think about what functionality the provided bstree_node struct offers.

Additional space refers to any space allocated between the time that the
function `bstree_difference` is called and the time it returns.
