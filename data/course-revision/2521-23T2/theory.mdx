# CSESoc COMP2521 Short Answer Practice Problems

## Q1

A and B are weighted, undirected graphs. B has the same edges as A, except the weights are increased by 3.

a) Do the minimal spanning trees of A and B always contain the same edges? Justify your answer.

b) Consider the tree of single-source shortest paths from some vertex (e.g. as produced by Dijkstra's algorithm).
Does this tree always contain the same edges in both graphs? Justify your answer.

## Q2

A particular graph is stored as an array of edges, each represented as a pair of vertices.
When a new edge is added, it is placed at the end of the array.
For example: [{2, 3}, {1, 2}, {0, 2}, {0, 1}].

a) What is the time complexity of breadth first search using this representation? Give your answer in terms
of V and E.

b) How can this representation be adjusted to improve the complexity of BFS, while maintaining the same
space complexity?

## Q3

Consider an arbitrary undirected connected graph G.
A graph G\* is constructed by replacing every edge of G with 4 edges and two vertices like this:

```
       G                            G*
                              ------ C ------
                             /               \
A ------------- B     =>    A                 B
                             \               /
                              ------ D ------
```

Is it true that G\* has an Euler cycle?
