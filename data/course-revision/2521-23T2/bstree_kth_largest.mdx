# Kth Largest in Binary Search Tree

Given a BST and a number `k`, find the `k`th largest element in the BST.

Implement the function `kthlargest` in `bstree_kth_largest.c`. This function will then be called by the `main` function in `test_bstree_kth_largest.c`.

To run your solution:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
$ make
$ ./test_bst_kth_largest
```

## Input format

The program will read from stdin.

The first line will be an integer desribing how many elements will be in the following tree.

Next should be a space separated list of integer values, representing the preorder traversal of the BST.

The next line will be an integer defining the number `k`.

## Output format

The program will write to stdout.

It will print integer which will be the `k`th largest element, followed by a newline.

## Sample 1

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
7
11 7 4 20 18 23 30
5
```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
11
```

Explanation: The 5th largest element is 11.

## Sample 2

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
7
4 2 6 1 3 5 7
5
```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
3
```

Explanation: The 4th largest element is 4.

## Sample 3

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
3
1 2 3
1
```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
3
```

Explanation: 3 is the largest element in the tree.

## Assumptions

- There will be at least `k` element in the tree.
- Each element in the tree will be an integer.
- Each node in the tree will contain an integer, possibly a left value and possibly a right value.
- The input list contains at least one and at most `MAX_BST_SIZE` values.
- The integers in the input list will always be positive and greater than 0;

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/2521-revision/bstree_kth_largest
$ 2521 autotest bstree_kth_largest
```
