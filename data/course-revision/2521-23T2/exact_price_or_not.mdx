# Exact Price or Not

Jack wants to pay for an item at the convenient store. However, this particular store does not give change, i.e., the amount you pay must be the exact amount of the item you are buying, and only takes exactly three coins. Luckily, Jack brought a lot of coins. See if Jack can get the exact price for a given item price `p` he wants using exactly three coins.

Complete the `sumCoins` function and return `1` if it's possible and `0` is it isn't.

To run your solution:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
$ make
$ ./test_exact_price_or_not
```

## Input format

The program will read from stdin.

The price of the item is given as an argument `p`. All Jack's coins are given in an array `coins` with a given length of `n`.

## Output format

The program will write to stdout.

Return `1` from the `sumCoins` function if Jack can find the right combination of three coins. If he cannot, then return `0`.

## Sample 1

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
150
3
50
50
50

```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
1

```

Explanation: The price of the item was 1.50. There are three 50c coins so you can get 1.50 by choosing all three 50c coins.

## Sample 2

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
400
6
50
10
20
10
100
200

```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
0

```

Explanation: There is no combination of three coins that add up to 4.

## Sample 3

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
500
3
200
200
200

```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
0

```

Explanation: Even thought we can get more than 5 with our three 2 coins, it is not the exact change for 5 so we return 0.

## Assumptions

- The values of the `p` and all values in the array `coins` are positive
- `n` will always be equal or larger than 3

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/2521-revision/exact_price_or_not
$ 2521 autotest exact_price_or_not
```
