title: Letter Pairs
desc: Find the pairs of letters in a string
class: COMP1511
difficulty: 1

A letter pair is two of the same character appearing next to each other in a string. E.g. in the string "terrifically" there are 2 letter pairs "rr" and "ll".

Write a program that reads a lowercase string as input, counts and prints out the number of letter pairs in a word.

## Assumptions

- The input string will have length 2-64 and be made of only lowercase alphabetical characters (a-z). There will be no spaces or punctuation marks.

- Two letter pairs of the same character, e.g. the two pairs of “ee” found in “beekeeper,” both count as separate letter pairs.

- No letters will appear consecutively more than twice (e.g. "aaa" will not be an input).


### Examples

Input: 

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs
$ dcc letter_pairs.c -o letter_pairs
$ ./letter_pairs
beekeeper
```

Output:

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs
2
```

Explanation: The double letter pair “ee” occurs twice in this word.

Input: 

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs
$ dcc letter_pairs.c -o letter_pairs
$ ./letter_pairs

```

Output:

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs
2
```

Explanation: The double letter pairs “ll” and “oo” each appear once in this word, so there are two double letter pairs.

Input: 

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs
$ dcc letter_pairs.c -o letter_pairs
$ ./letter_pairs
distinction
```

Output:

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs
0
```

Explanation: There are no double letter pairs in this word - although some letters appear twice in the word, they do not appear consecutively, so they do not count as double letters.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/letter_pairs:~
$ 1511 autotest letter_pairs
```
