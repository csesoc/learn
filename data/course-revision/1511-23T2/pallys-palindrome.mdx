# Pally's Palindromes

Pally's favourite word is `saippuakivikauppias` which is Finnish for a dealer in lye (caustic soda). It's the longest known palindromic word!

A palindrome is a word where the letters read backwards, give the same word. Another example is the word `racecar`.

Help Pally out by writing a program that which reads a string and tests if it is a palindrome.

Given `racecar\n` as input, it should print `String is a palindrome`. Otherwise if it is not a palindrome, it should print `String is not a palindrome`.

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/billys_books
$ dcc pallys_palindromes.c -o pallys_palindromes
$ ./pallys_palindromes
racecar
String is a palindrome
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

Do not use scanf - use fgets to read the string.

You can assume lines contain at most `4096` characters.

Checking the palindrome should be case insensitive, i.e. `a` should be treated as the same letter as `A`.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/pallys_palindromes:~
$ 1511 csesoc-autotest pallys_palindromes
```
