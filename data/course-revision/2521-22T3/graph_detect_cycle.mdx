# Graph Detect Cycle

Given an undirected, unweighted graph with at least one edge, write a function that returns true if the graph contains a cycle, and false otherwise.

Implement the function `graphDetectCycle` in `graph_detect_cycle.c`. This function will then be called by the `main` function in `test_graph_detect_cycle.c`.

To run your solution:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
$ dcc test_graph_detect_cycle.c graph_detect_cycle.c Graph.c -o test_graph_detect_cycle
$ ./test_graph_detect_cycle
```

## Input format

The program will read from stdin.

The first line should be `n` the number of vertices in your graph.

The following lines (until EOF) contains the two vertices connected by an edge. Vertices are numbered `0` to `n-1` inclusive.

E.g `0 <-> 1` for an edge between vertices 0 and 1.

## Output format

The program will write to stdout.

It will print `Has cycle` if your `graphDetectCycle` function returns true, and `Does not have cycle` if it returns false.

## Sample 1

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
3
0 <-> 1
1 <-> 2

```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
Does not have cycle
```

Explanation: The graph `0 <-> 1 <-> 2` does not contain any cycles.

## Sample 2

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
3
0 <-> 1
1 <-> 2
0 <-> 2

```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
Has cycle
```

Explanation: The graph contains a cycle for vertices 0, 1, 2.

## Sample 3

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
6
0 <-> 1
1 <-> 2
2 <-> 3
2 <-> 4
2 <-> 5

```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
Does not have cycle
```

Explanation: The graph does not contain any cycles.

## Assumptions

- Graphs are undirected.
- Graphs are unweighted.
- Graphs are connected.
- Graphs are not empty.
- Graphs have no self-loops.
- Graphs have no multiple edges.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/2521-revision/graph_detect_cycle
$ 2521 autotest graph_detect_cycle
```
