Given an array of only 0's, 1's, or 2's, write a O(n) function which sorts this array in ascending order.

Implement the function `sort` in `sort_the_trio.c`. This function will be then be called by the `main` function in
`test_sort_the_trio.c`.

To run your solution:

```bash:~/2521-revision/sort_the_trio
$ make
$ ./test_sort_the_trio
```

## Input format

The program will read from stdin until `ctrl + d` is entered.

It can only read inputs which are either 0, 1, or 2, and they have to be newline or space seperated. These ints will then be passed into an array.

E.g) `0 2 2 1 0 2 1` will create an array with elements `0 2 2 1 0 2 1` respectively.

## Output format

The program will write to stdout.

It will print each element in the array, allowing you to check if your `sort` function correctly sorts the array.

## Sample 1

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/sort_the_trio:~
0 2 1 2 0 1 1 2 1
`ctrl + d`
```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/sort_the_trio:~
0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
```

Explanation: Input must be in sorted ascending order.

## Sample 2

Input:

```bash:~/2521-revision/sort_the_trio:~
1 2
0 1 1 2
0
2 1
`ctrl + d`
```

Output:

```bash:~/2521-revision/sort_the_trio:~
0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
```

Explanation: Input must be in sorted ascending order

## NOTE

- You do not have to read input from stdin, and pass it into an array. This has been done for you in `test_sort_the_trio.c`.
- You are only required to implement the function `sort` in `sort_the_trio.c`, which is given an array of 0's, 1's, or 2's, read from stdin.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/2521-revision/sort_the_trio:~
$ 2521 autotest sort_the_trio
```
