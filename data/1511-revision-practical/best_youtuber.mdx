Your program is given a list of thought-provoking YouTube videos. Each video has a creator and a number of likes. (They donâ€™t, however, have any dislikes because YouTube removed the dislike button. ðŸ˜¢)

Your task is to print out the YouTuber from among the videos with the best likes-to-videos ratio, along with that YouTuber's video count and total number of likes to prove it. They are thusly crowned the best YouTuber!

A YouTuberâ€™s likes-to-videos ratio is calculated by $\frac{\text{their total likes}}{\text{their number of videos}}$.

If there's a tie, the program should print "It's a tie! There is no best YouTuber."

Each line of input should be in the format `[video creator], [video likes]` (note the separating comma).

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/best_youtuber
$ dcc best_youtuber.c -o best_youtuber
$ ./best_youtuber
**Wild Candy, 84317**
**Logan Paul, 9185**
**Wild Candy, 20097**
**Jaden Smith, 35664**
**Wild Candy, 15321**
**Logan Paul, 75820**
<CTRL+D>
Logan Paul is the best YouTuber.
Number of videos: 2
Total likes: 85005
```

There are three YouTubers found from among the given videos: Wild Candy, Logan Paul, and Jaden Smith. Calculating each of their likes-to-videos ratios gives $39,911.\dot{6}$, $42,502.5$, and $35,664$, respectively.

As Logan Paul has the greatest likes-to-videos ratio, he's the best YouTuber.

```bash:~/1511-revision/best_youtuber
$ dcc best_youtuber.c -o best_youtuber
$ ./best_youtuber
**Will Smith, 2000**
**Logan Paul, 2000**
**Will Smith, 2000**
<CTRL+D>
It's a tie! There is no best YouTuber.
```
