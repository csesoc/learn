title: Anagram?
desc: Determine if two words are an anagram or not
class: COMP1511
difficulty: Medium

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word.

Write a program `anagram.c` which scans two lines of input, where each line contains a single word which is a string.

Your program should then determine whether the two words are an anagram or not.

The output from your program should look **exactly** like this:

```bash:~/1511-revision/anagram
$ dcc anagram.c -o anagram
$ ./anagram
angel
glean
Your two words are an anagram! 
```

```bash:~/1511-revision/anagram
$ ./anagram
yummy
mummy
Your two words are not an anagram! 
```

## Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications

- You may assume all words will be in lowercase only
- For both lines of input, the string will be of length $N$ ($0 \leq N \leq 1024$)
- Don't forget the new line the new line character that is created at the end of each string.

## CSE Autotest

When you think your program is working, you can use CSE autotest to test your solution.

```bash:~/1511-revision/anagram:~
$ 1511 autotest anagram
```
