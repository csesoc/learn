# 2D Arrays in C 🥳

Welcome to our guide on 2D Arrays in C!

Here you will learn how to use and understand seamlessly the very scary topic that is
2D arrays!

To break it down nice and easy, we will be covering 6 operations:

- **Creating** a 2D Array 🔧
- **Initialising** a 2D Array 📚
- **Accessing** elements in a 2D Array 🔍
- **Editing** elements in a 2D Array ✏️
- **Iterating** through a 2D Array 🔁

# Creating a 2D Array 🔧

## Preface 🐶

A 2D array is often referred to as an array of arrays, or a matrix! This is because it consist of rows and columns, and thus takes the shape of a matrix!

## Getting Started 🎉

To create a 2D array in C, you will need to declare it using the following syntax:

```
<datatype> <arrayname> [row_size][col_size];
```

Where:

- `<datatype>` is the datatype of the array
  _(i.e. `int`, `char`, `bool`, etc...)_
- `<arrayname>` is the name of the array _(i.e. `my_array`)_
- `row_size` is the number of rows in the array
- `col_size` is the number of columns in the array

For example, to create a 2D array of integers with 2 rows and 4 columns, you would use the following declaration:

```
int my_array[2][4];
```

Pretty easy right?

### ✅ Now lets get started on **Initialising** an array 😎
