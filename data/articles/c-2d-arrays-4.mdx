# Editing elements in a 2D Array ✏️

## Preface 🐶

So we've learnt how to access elements in an array, but whats also cool is that we can change those elements too!

## Getting Started 🎉

To edit an element in a 2D array you need **two** things!

- The **row** index
- The **column** index

With those two things we can access and thus edit any element!

> Remember that indexes start at `0`, so the **first row** and **first column** will have indexes of `0`.

Say we have the following array:

```
int my_array[2][4] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4}, // First row
  {5, 6, 7, 8} // Second row
};
```

We know that to access element `2`, we can do the following:

```
int my_num = my_array[0][1];
```

Luckily, editing it is very similar!

Let say we want to change the element at `[0][1]` to be 42, we can do the following:

```
my_array[0][1] = 42;
```

Pretty cool right?
Onto the final topic we go!
