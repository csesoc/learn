So far we have only looked at two types of requests, GET and POST. In this exercise, we will want to flesh these out a little bit more and also take a look at the other two types of request, UPDATE and REMOVE. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete, each of these corresponding to a type of request. Usually a backend would implement all of these.

## GET

Let us begin by giving us the option to collect ALL venues. Right now we can only find one by name. An easy way to do this would check if a query paramter is passed to our `/venues` GET route, and if not then return all venues. Hmm, there are a few ways we could do this, I'm thinking like this:

```javascript:venuesWatcher/index.js
let item = undefined
if (req.query.name) {
  let query = { name: req.query.name }
  item = await col.findOne(query)
} else {
  item = await col.find()
}
if (item) {
  res.status(200).send(item)
} else {
  res.status(404).send({ error: 'Not found!' })
}
```

Now let's try running our server and making a request to `http://localhost:5000/venues?name=crumbs` ... success! How about without the query parameter?

We get a weird response, definitely not what we were after.

This is because the `find` method returns a cursor, not the documents in the database. Essentially a pointer to the database. This is not very helpful, because we want the actual documents. All we need to do is add `.toArray()` to the end of our find method. Now see if we are returned a list of venues.

Excellent, so now we can collect a list of all venues, or a venue that matches the `name` query parameter.

But a venue's name doesn't have to be unique, for example if one of our favourite venues is McDonald's, which one are we talking about?

Instead, let's change this query parameter to be `id` and we will use the document id to search. Add `ObjectID` to our MongoDB import at the top of your file, this let's us match the MongoDB ID object. Our if statement will also look slightly different:

```javascript:venuesWatcher/index.js
if (req.query.id) {
  item = await col.find(ObjectID(req.query.id)).toArray()
} else {
  item = await col.find().toArray()
}
```

Now test it out! You can get object ids from first collecting all documents (not passing any query params) then making another request with an `id` query parameter.

## PUT

The PUT request corresponds to the UPDATE operation. Create a new route, this time make it a `put` route to the `/venues` route and with an async callback function.

Inside this route body, the main function we want to invoke is `col.updateOne`. The following line accomplishes this:

```javascript:venuesWatcher/index.js
await col.updateOne({ _id: ObjectID(req.query.id) }, { $set: req.body })
```

The first argument is our search query, so matching those with the query parameter `id`. The second argument indicates our update operation, here we are doing a `$set`, so anything we pass in the body of the put function will be updated. For example if we passed the `id` of our "crumbs" venue from before and in our request body we passed:

```json:
{
  "name": "New Crumbs",
  "rating": 4.7
}
```

Then we would update both the name and rating of "crumbs" to these new values. Make sure you do a `res.send` with an appropriate message to indicate to the client it has been successful!

## DELETE

Finally, let's try out the DELETE route. Same as PUT, make a new route with an async callback and path to `/venues` again.

We can simply copy and paste the function body from the PUT route, but remove the second argument to `updateOne` and change `updateOne` to `deleteOne`. It should look something like this now:

```javascript:venuesWatcher/index.js
app.delete('/venues', async (req, res) => {
  await col.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectID(req.query.id) })
  res.status(200).send({ message: 'success!' })
})
```

Now try starting your server and sending a delete request with an `id` query parameter. If you then try and get the full list of venues you should find one of them missing.
