## Overview

This COMP1511 Cheatsheet should provide you with a quick overview of the 1511 course and its key concepts. This won't cover all the possible edgecases, and any further questions should refer to the [C documetation](https://devdocs.io/c/), or other people.

## Basic Syntax

These contain the basic syntax of C.

| Function Definition | `return_type name(parameters){};` | Provides the definition for a function.                                                                                                                    |
| If Statement        | `if (expression) {}`              | Evaluates your expression and executes the code block if true                                                                                              |
| If Else Statement   | `else if (expression) {}`         | Requires a previous if statement, will act similarly to an if statement                                                                                    |
| Else Statement      | `else (expression) {}`            | Requires a previous if statement, will execute when the if statement is false                                                                              |

## I/O (Input/Output)

Most I/O functions are defined under the header `stdio.h`.
| Element | C Syntax | Explanation |
|---------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fgets | `fgets(char *dest, int n, FILE *stream)` | fgets will read bytes from a stream (STDIN), into an array pointed to by dest, reading until either of 3 conditions are fulfilled. n-1 characters are read, a \n character is read, or the end of stream. |
| printf | `printf(char *format, ...)` | printf formats and writes the string pointed by format to standard output (Prints to console) |
| scanf | `scanf(char *format, ...)` | scanf reads data from stdin and stores them in locations given by the additional specifiers |

### Format Specifications

Format Specifiers for use in your `printf()` and `scanf()` functions.

| Element | Explanation            |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| d       | Signed Decimal Integer |
| f       | Decimal Floating Point |
| c       | Character              |
| s       | String                 |

## Data Structures

A list of basic data structures that we have learnt over the course of COMP1511.

| Element | C Syntax          | Explanation                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enum    | `enum {};`        | Enums define a 'collection' of keywords. Under the hood, they are simply just integers.                                                                   |
| Array   | `type name[size]` | A contiguous (adjacent) space of memory that allows us to 'associate' values together. Remember that they can be chained to form n-th dimensional arrays. |
| Structs | `struct name {};` | A container that is able to hold varying types unlike arrays. They generally have to be instantiated to be used                                           |

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are a special form of data structures in that they are not implicitly defined in any C standard library.
The main advantage of linked lists over arrays are that they are dynamic and their size can be changed at runtime (they can be changed after you compile the program) unlike arrays, where their size must be defined at compile-time.

```c
int arr[300];
// Here the compiler must know the size of the array before it is compiled.
```

Note: There is an exception to this, it is called a variable-length array and is supported since C99. However, these should not be used.

```c
void foo(int n) {
	int arr[n];
	// This is a VLA and should not be used.
}
```

#### Defining our Nodes

```c
struct Node {
	int data; // holds the information stored in our node
	struct node *next; // connects our nodes together
}
```

Remember that Linked Lists are (usually) not stored contiguously in memory, meaning that they are usually at random locations throughout memory. Therefore, we will need to use pointers to connect our scattered nodes together.

```c
struct Node *head = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
head->data = 3;
head->next = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
head->next->next = NULL;
head->next->data = 2;
// This is equivalent to 3 -> 2 -> NULL
```

## Standard Libraries
