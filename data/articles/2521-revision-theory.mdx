  </MultiChoice.Question>
  <MultiChoice.Answer content="14" />
  <MultiChoice.Answer content="15" isCorrect>
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      Easier: Kruskal's algorithm

      Harder: Prim's algorithm

      Using principals of Kruskal's algorithm:

      A minimum spanning tree is a tree which contains all vertices, has no cycles, and has the smallest total weight of all possible spanning trees.
      Since we want the smallest total weight, start by adding the edge with the smallest weight into your MST graph. In this case, it is edge VW with weight 1.
      We then repeat the process for the next smallest edge: UW, RV, QR, or ST etc, continually adding them to your MST as long as the edge does not form a cycle. If the edge forms a cycle,
      move on to next smallest edge.

    a) `breadthFirst(g, 3)`

    b) `depthFirst(g, 0)`

  </MultiChoice.Question>
  <MultiChoice.Answer>
    a) 3, 2, 0, 6, 5, 4, 1

    b) 0, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6

  </MultiChoice.Answer>
  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    a) 3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6

    b) 0, 1, 5, 2, 3, 6, 4
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      **a) Solution for breadth-first traversal**

      Given vertex v = 3, our breadthFirst traversal will begin at v = 3.

      Since vertex x = 3 has not been visited, it is printed as first element. The for loop
      then checks every vertex y from 0 to nV - 1.

      If y is connected to vertex x via
      an edge, and has not been visited, add y to queue.

      Since y = 0 and y = 2 are
      the only vertices which are connected to x = 3 and haven't been visited, add them to queue
      respectively.

      Vertex 0 is then dequeued, where x = 0 (note queue is a first in, first out ADT).

      Since vertex x = 0 has not been visited, it is
      printed as second element.

      The for loop then checks every vertex y from 0 to nV - 1.

      If y is connected to vertex x via
      an edge, and has not been visited, add y to queue.

      Since y = 1, y = 4, and y = 5 are
      the only vertices which are connected to x = 0 and haven't been visited, add them to queue
      respectively.

      This process is repeated until the queue is empty, and resulted in the vertices printed in this
      order: 3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 5.


      **b) Solution for depth-first traversal**

      Similar process to part a), except depthFirst() doesn't use a queue,
      but a stack (a first in, last out ADT).

      Another difference is that the for loop
      starts checking from the largest vertex nV - 1, to the smallest vertex 0.

  <MultiChoice.Question>
    ## Question 4 - Euler paths 
    
    Does an Euler path exist for this graph?
    
    <Centerer>
      <img style={{maxWidth: '500px'}} src="/images/comp2521-revision/1-euler.png" alt="Graph" width="70%" />
    </Centerer>

  </MultiChoice.Question>

  <MultiChoice.Answer content="No"/>
  <MultiChoice.Answer
    content="Yes"
    isCorrect>
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      An Euler Path does not exist for this graph.

      It is known that a graph has an Euler path if and only if:
          - It is connected
          - It has exactly two vertices that have an odd degree

      The given graph satisfies the first criteria as it is connected.

      However, it does not satisfy the second criteria, as none of the vertices have
      an odd degree. In general terms, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges
      connecting it. Looking at this graph, we see:

      <table >
        <tr>
          <th>Node</th><th>Degree</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td><td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td><td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td><td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td><td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7</td><td>4</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      And realise that none of the nodes/vertices have an odd degree. Hence the second
      criteria is unfufilled.

      Hence, it is concluded that an Euler path does not exist for this graph.

  <MultiChoice.Question>
    ## Question 10 - BFS and DFS

    What is the difference between the implementation of iterative BFS and iterative DFS and the theoretical difference between the two?

  </MultiChoice.Question>
  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    BFS uses a queue, checking all neighbours of a node before moving on to another node, and DFS uses a stack, checking every new node as it is found.

    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      BFS uses a queue to store the next node to be explored. This makes it so that when a node is visited, we add all its neighbours to the queue and when we check through the queue, we check all the most recently added nodes, i.e., all the added neighbours of a node, before we move further down the graph.

      DFS uses a stack, meaning we explore by checking the most recently added node to the stack. This means we will keep checking the most recently added node before we check previously added nodes, meaning we will keep going though the tree until we hit the end before we check a particular nodes neighbours.
    </MultiChoice.Explanation>

    ## Question 11 - Graph ordering

    Which of the following is post order?

  </MultiChoice.Question>
  <MultiChoice.Answer>
    1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call recursion (left-subtree).
    
    2. Visit the root (i.e., do work on the current node).
    
    3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call recursion (right-subtree).
  </MultiChoice.Answer>

  <MultiChoice.Answer>
    1. Visit the root (i.e., do work on the current node).

    2. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call recursion (left-subtree).

    3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call recursion (right-subtree).

  </MultiChoice.Answer>

  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call recursion (left-subtree).

    2. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call recursion (right-subtree).

    3. Visit the root (i.e., do work on the current node).
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      For Inorder, you traverse from the left subtree to the root then to the right subtree.

      For Preorder, you traverse from the root to the left subtree then to the right subtree.

      For Post order, you traverse from the left subtree to the right subtree then to the root.
    </MultiChoice.Explanation>

  <MultiChoice.Answer content="rotate_left(8), rotate_right(5), rotate_left(10)" />
  <MultiChoice.Answer content="rotate_left(5), rotate_right(8), rotate_right(8)"/>
  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    rotate_right(8), rotate_left(5), rotate_right(10)
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      Rotating right on node 8 brings the 7 up to 8's position. Then we rotate left on the 5 to bring up the 7 again and finally rotate right on 10 to push the 7 into the root position.

  <MultiChoice.Answer content="1" />
  <MultiChoice.Answer content="2" />
  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    3
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      The Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It works by choosing edges in sorted order by lowest weight (unless it forms a cycle) until all vertices are included.

      Let's walk through applying Kruskal's algorithm to the graph.

      We start with an empty set of edges which represents the MST we want to build. We also keep a count of the number of vertices that have been included in the MST so we can stop when we have included all vertices.

      We sort the existing edges in the graph by weight and start to choose them by lowest weight edge to add to the MST.

      We choose the first edge E-G with weight 1 and add it to our MST. We then check that our new MST does not form a cycle after this addition and keep the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tQxZSzH.png)

      Next add the edge G-F with weight 2 to our MST. We check that it does not form a cycle and keep the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1DgtJGV.png)

      Next add the edge A-C with weight 3 to our MST. We check that it does not form a cycle and keep the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pWk6eb2.png)

      Next add the edge E-F with weight 4 to our MST. We find that after this addtion our MST now has a cycle, so we remove the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/te21CM1.png)

      Next add the edge E-D with weight 5 to our MST. We check that it does not form a cycle and keep the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ruMBsMN.png)

      Next we find two edges with the same weigth 6: A-D and F-D. We can choose these edges to add to the MST in arbitrary order since it would not make a difference to the minimum weight of our MST.

      We'll add the edge A-D first. We check that it does not form a cycle and keep the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mED0IRd.png)

      Next we add the edge F-D; the remaining edge with weigth 6. We find that after this addtion our MST now has a cycle, so we remove the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zNM0uo2.png)

      Next add the edge C-F with weight 7 to our MST. We find that after this addtion our MST now has a cycle, so we remove the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Zk0qOEl.png)

      Next we add the edge A-B with weight 8 to our MST. We check that it does not form a cycle and keep the edge.

      ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KSTqyfQ.png)

      At this point our MST contains all the vertices from the original graph, and hence we have found the minimum spanning tree.

      To answer the question, there were three instances where we added an edge and found that it formed a cycle in our MST.

  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    rotate_right(2), rotate_left(6)
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      Rotating shifts the root node in the direction of the rotation. Hence as 2 moves down to the right, we do rotate_right(2).

      Similar logic can be applied for rotate_left(6).

    ## Question 16 - Time complexity (Challenge)

    What is the time complexity of the following function? You may assume the value of `n` is positive.

    ```c:print_pairs.c
    void print_pairs(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j += i) {
                printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

  </MultiChoice.Question>
  <MultiChoice.Answer content="O(n)"/>
  <MultiChoice.Answer isCorrect>
    O(n * log(n))
    <MultiChoice.Explanation>
      We firstly know that we will iterate through the outside loop `n` times, that gives us our `n` value.

      The number of iterations of the inside loop is reduced on every iteration of `i`, hence the number of inside loop iterations is being reduced in a logarithmic fashion.
