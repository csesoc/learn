Have you ever wanted to be a spy? Send secret messages?

Well! A lot of the time you use the internet, messages you send to another person are sent like secret messages :D This means that you write your message in ordinary words, or **plaintext**, and just before it is sent, your software makes it look like mumbo jumbo, officially called **ciphertext**, before sending it to the receiver. But just before they receive it, their software untangles the message to plaintext so the receiver can read it normally.

The method to convert data (like a message) into a secret code that hides the information's true meaning is called **encryption**.

The reverse process of encryption, in essence, converting from secret code to original data, is called decryption.

Here is a diagram from a MATH3411 lecture detailing the process of sending over a message with encryption and decryption.
