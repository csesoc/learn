# Part 5

Variables are a fundamental concept in programming because it allows us to store and modify data depending on where or how our program is used. In a React app, variables are made using something called the `useState` hook. React hooks are functions that can be called from within our functional components like `App` to use various core React features.

To use the `useState` hook, first import it into our <FileName>App.jsx</FileName> file. Then inside the `App` functional component and above the return statement, write the following:

```jsx:src/App.jsx {5-6, 8} showLineNumbers=4
import './styles/App.css'
import './styles/Card.css'
import logo from './assets/logo512.png'
import { ReactComponent as Star } from './assets/star.svg'
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {

  const [name, setName] = useState("Machiavelli Ristorante Italiano")

  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          Food
          <img src={logo} alt="logo" />
          Places
        </nav>
      </header>
```

```jsx:diff:jfkdlsa showLineNumbers
+ const App = () => {
  return (null)
}
```

Calling the `useState` function returns two things: a state value and a function that can be used to change this state value while our app is running. We use the `const [name, setname]` JavaScript "destructuring" syntax to assign the variable `name` to the first return value and the variable `setName` to the second return value.

`useState` takes in an argument -- the initial value of the state. We give it the string `"Machiavelli Ristorante Italiano"` because we want the state `name` to store the name of our restaurant.

We can now use this `name` state in our app. Replace our hard-coded restaurant name with the `name` state:

```jsx:src/App.jsx
const App = () => {

  const [name, setName] = useState("Machiavelli Ristorante Italiano")

  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          Food
          <img src={logo} alt="logo" />
          Places
        </nav>
      </header>
      <main>
        <h1>My List</h1>
        <p>
          Here is a list of all the restaurants, cafes, dessert bars and other eateries that I want
          to keep a record of either because I like them, dislike them, or would like to find out.
        </p>
        <div className="card">
          <h3>{name}</h3>
          <h4>Pizza · Pasta</h4>
          <h4>123 Clarence St, Sydney NSW 2000</h4>
          <h4>
            <a href="https://www.machiavelli.com.au" target="blank">
              www.machiavelli.com.au
            </a>
          </h4>
```

Our app should still be working as it was before. Let's turn all the other restaurant information into state.

```jsx:src/App.jsx
const App = () => {

  const [name, setName] = useState("Machiavelli Ristorante Italiano")
  const [tags, setTags] = useState(["Pizza", "Pasta"])
  const [address, setAddress] = useState("123 Clarence St, Sydney NSW 2000")
  const [website, setWebsite] = useState("https://www.machiavelli.com.au")
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState("Authentic Italian restaurant serving a traditional Neapolitan cuisine. The Linguine Gamberi was good value but a little bland in flavour.")
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(4)
  const [visits, setVisits] = useState(3)

  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          Food
          <img src={logo} alt="logo" />
          Places
        </nav>
      </header>
      <main>
        <h1>My List</h1>
        <p>
          Here is a list of all the restaurants, cafes, dessert bars and other eateries that I want
          to keep a record of either because I like them, dislike them, or would like to find out.
        </p>
        <div className="card">
          <h3>{name}</h3>
          <h4>{tags}</h4>
          <h4>{address}</h4>
          <h4>
            <a href={website} target="blank">
              {website}
            </a>
          </h4>
          <p>{notes}</p>
          <div className="metricsContainer">
            <div className="ratingContainer">
              Rating {rating}/5
              <Star className='starIcon' />
              <Star className='starIcon' />
              <Star className='starIcon' />
              <Star className='starIcon' />
            </div>
            <div className="visitsContainer">Visited {visits} times</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </main>
    </>
  )
}
```

We are using a few different data types to store different types of state. Our restaurant's `name`, `address`, `website` and `notes` are just JavaScript `String`s. `tags` is a JS `Array`, which is an ordered collection of items, in this case `String`s. `rating`and `visits` are `Number`s.

Let's account for these different data types in our rendering.

Firstly the `tags` array can be printed as a string of tags separated by bullets (•) with `{tags.join(" • ")}`.

```jsx:src/App.jsx
        <div className="card">
          <h3>{name}</h3>
          <h4>{tags.join(" • ")}</h4>
          <h4>{address}</h4>
          <h4>
            <a href={website} target="blank">
              {website}
            </a>
          </h4>
```

Our `rating` is currently just being rendered as a number but the four stars are still hard-coded. To render a number of stars based on our rating we'll make a function that returns a list of `<Star />` components:

```jsx:src/App.jsx
const App = () => {

  const [name, setName] = useState("Machiavelli Ristorante Italiano")
  const [tags, setTags] = useState(["Pizza", "Pasta"])
  const [address, setAddress] = useState("123 Clarence St, Sydney NSW 2000")
  const [website, setWebsite] = useState("https://www.machiavelli.com.au")
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState("Authentic Italian restaurant serving a traditional Neapolitan cuisine. The Linguine Gamberi was good value but a little bland in flavour.")
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(4)
  const [visits, setVisits] = useState(3)

  const renderStars = (numStars) => {
    let stars = [] // Declare an empty array
    for (let i = 0; i < numStars; i++) {
      // Add a new Star component to the stars array.
      stars.push(
        <Star className='starIcon' /> 
      )
    }
    return stars
  }

  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          Food
          <img src={logo} alt="logo" />
          Places
        </nav>
      </header>
```

This is an arrow function that takes in an integer `numStars`, then loops for `numStars` times, each time adding a new `<Star />` component to the `stars` array. Finally it returns the `stars` array.

Call the `renderStars` function in place of where we hard-coded our stars, passing in the `rating` state as an argument:

```jsx:src/App.jsx
          <div className="metricsContainer">
            <div className="ratingContainer">
              Rating {rating}/5
              {renderStars(rating)}
            </div>
            <div className="visitsContainer">Visited {visits} times</div>
          </div>
```

We should now see four stars rendered as before, but if we open the browser console (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I) we'll see a warning `"Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop."`.

In React, all components have a special `key` attribute, and whenever we render a list of components, they each need a unique value for the special `key` property. To fix this issue, add a `key={i}` to our `Star />` components in the `for` loop.:

```jsx:src/App.jsx
  const renderStars = (numStars) => {
    let stars = [] // Declare an empty array
    for (let i = 0; i < numStars; i++) {
      // Add a new Star component to the stars array.
      stars.push(
        <Star key={i} className='starIcon' />
      )
    }
    return stars
  }
```

In this tutorial we learned how to store state and render it. In later tutorials we'll also learn how to modify state based on user input.
