# CSESoc COMP2521 Fundamentals Practice Problems

There is a set of 8 practical programming problems designed to help solidify your COMP2521 fundamentals before you tackle algorithms.

There are autotests for each problem on cse servers which you can use to check your solutions.

To start, log in to cse servers via ssh and create a new folder:

```bash:~
$ mkdir 2521-fundamentals
$ cd 2521-fundamentals
```

Then run the following command to copy the template files:

```bash:~/2521-fundamentals
$ 2521 fetch fundamentals
```
