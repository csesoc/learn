## Vision ⚡️

CSESoc is where students gather to socialise and extend their technical knowledge outside the classroom. Educational content has previously been delivered via workshops. However, this limits people who're uncomfortable with holding workshops, or want to contribute in other formats, from contributing.

CSESoc Learn empowers students from various backgrounds to contribute to the wider CSE community by:
- opening up new formats of contributing such as articles, tutorials and videos
- providing an ergonomic content creation experience, allowing creators to focus on what they do best

CSESoc Learn also focuses strongly on delightful UI/UX, driving engagement and raising the bar for learning experiences at CSESoc.

## Code style

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) are used together for formatting and linting. They're configured in the repo.
