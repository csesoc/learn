            What kind of content can I present on the CSESoc Learning Platform?
          </Text>
          <Text>
            The Learning Platform will be a home for technical educational
            content that is not explored in the lectures and tutorials of your
            uni courses, but nonetheless highly relevant to students. For
            inspiration, you could write an introductory overview of a broad
            area like theory of computation, or you could present a deep dive
            into something beyond the scope of a uni course, like the inner
            workings of Git. You could focus on explaining theoretical concepts
            like algorithmic time complexity, or you teach something practical
            like coding up a discord bot. Don't let our imagination limit you!
